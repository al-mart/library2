# The Java Programming Environment

`javac Welcome.java`

`java Welcome`

What happened? The javac program is the Java compiler. It compiles the file Welcome.java into the file Welcome.class. The java program launches the Java virtual machine. It executes the bytecodes that the compiler placed in the class file.
