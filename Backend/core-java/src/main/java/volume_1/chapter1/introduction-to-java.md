The Java “White Paper” Buzzwords
The authors of Java wrote an influential white paper that explains
their design goals and accomplishments.
They also published a shorter overview that is organized along 
the following 11 buzzwords:

1. Simple  ( it's simpler that C++, but resembles it)
2. Object-Oriented  (replaces multiple inheritance from c++ with interfaces)
3. Distributed   ( distributed on servers, can make tcp/ip calls)
4. Robust       (compiler can detect problems, no pinter corruption available)
5. Secure      ()
6. Architecture-Neutral  ( runs on java virtual machine that can run on windows , linux )
7. Portable
8. Interpreted
9. High-Performance
10. Multithreaded 
11. Dynamic (Libraries can freely add new methods and instance variables without any effect on their clients)
